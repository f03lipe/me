_Thoughts, projects, readings_

_2013 was cr42y._

It was certainly my busiest year ever.

## Projects

This year, I:

- [transcoded the code in the MIT SICp video-lectures from 1986.](http://f03lipe.github.com/sicp-code)

- [developed meavisa.org](http://meavisa.org)

- [developed vempraruavem.org](http://vempraruavem.org)

- [finally finished turmacidada.org](http://turmacidada.org)

- [developed magnetproject.us](http://github.com/f03lipe/magnetproject)

#### the little ones

- [coded this tiny-list interpreter in <70 lines of Python](https://github.com/f03lipe/tiny-lisp)

- [programmed a substitution decipher in C/Python](http://github.com/f03lipe/decipher)

- [wrote a python parser for Tom's Obvious Minimal Language](http://github.com/f03lipe/toml-python)

- [put together a tool for memorizing Pi](http://f03lipe.github.io/memorizepie/)

## Readings

As far as numbers are concerned, 2013 readings were so-so. I think I managed to
harness my limited reading-time by going straight to the "classics".
In chronological order I read this year

- __Book I of The Wealth of Nations__, by Adam Smith ❤  
  February

- __Book II of The Wealth of Nations__, by Adam Smith  
  March

- __Book III of The Wealth of Nations__, by Adam Smith  
  March

- __Poor Economics__, by Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo ❤  
  May. Because I took the 14.74x course from Edx.

- __Manufaturing Consent__, by Noam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman  
  May

- __Animal Farm__, by George Orwell  
  June

- __1984__, by George Orwell ❤  
  June

- __Accelerated C++__, by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo  
  June. This one is _technical_, but I treat it as reading.

- __Chaos__, by James Gleick  
  July. This one I bought on Amazon after Robert Sapolsky recommended it in
  these [video-lectures](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNnIGh9g6fA). It's good, 
  but not that much.

- __The Problems of Philosophy__, by Bertrand Russell  
  August. Very entertaining!

- __Understanding Power__, by Noam Chomsky ❤  
  November.

I put little ❤s in the top 5.

## Application.

As the last-minute of 2013, I decided to wait a year before applying to
universities in the United States. Many pending projects, ya know.
