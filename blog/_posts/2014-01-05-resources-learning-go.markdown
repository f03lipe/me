Keeping up with [New Year resolutions](/blog/2014/01/01/first/),
I started studying [Go](http://golang.org).

What godless person doesn't love a list of resources, right?

#### For starters  

- [GoLang website](http://golang.org), obviously.
- [GoLang Book](http://www.golang-book.com/). An introduction to programming in Go.
- [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/).
- [A Tour Of Go](http://tour.golang.org/) for programmers. 

#### For grown-ups

- [Go Specification](http://golang.org/ref/spec)
- [Writing Web Applications](http://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/) in Go

#### Talks 

- ["Public Static Void"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kj5ApnhPAE), a small
talk at OSCON'10 by Rob Pike, from Google, about Go being prodly statically
typed.
- ["Go's Programming Environment"](https://vimeo.com/53221558)
- ["Go for Pythonistas"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elu0VpLzJL8)
- ["Go Concurrency Patterns"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfMOD7tZAw4) by Rob Pike, at Google I/O 2012
- ["Writing Web Apps in Go"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-i0hat7pdpk). Yes, same title.

I'm still deciding on a Go project to take up, in order to develop my skills.
