Yes. Rust version of [__Resources for Learning Go__](/blog/2014/01/05/resources-learning-go/).

- [A 30 minute introduction to Rust](http://words.steveklabnik.com/a-30-minute-introduction-to-rust).  
  A highlight of two of the most important aspects of the language: the concept of ownership and concurrency. __Not really an introduction.__

- [Rust: What I learnt so far](http://www.darkcoding.net/software/rust-what-i-learnt-so-far/).  
  This is slightly outdated.
